-- | Collocation Trajectory optimization...
-- |
-- | optimize over f( x_i, u_i, dt )
-- |		x(t) => x_i
-- |	      u(t) => u_i
-- |		dt (in some cases, usually if endpoint / endconditions specified)
-- |
-- | subject x_(i+1) = x_i + dt * f( x_i, u_i )
-- | Also enforce dynamics at the "knotpoints" -- midpoints of the third order spline of the state (assumed the control is first order spline).
